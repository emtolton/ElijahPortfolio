          <p>At first, I wasn't a fan of running. In fact, hated it. But, my friends were all joining the cross country team. Even though running was hard and it hurt I joined the XC team.
        
          <p>As the seasons passed, I started to enjoy running more and more! What began as a social activity soon turned into something much more. I started to feel healthier, stronger, and more energized, both physically and mentally. Running was no longer a chore but an exciting challenge I looked forward to every day.</p>
        
          <p>By my senior year, I had become a <strong>team captain</strong> of the cross country team. It was such an honor to lead my teammates, and I felt the pride of being part of something bigger than myself.</p>
        
          <p>One of the highlights of my senior year was contributing to breaking the <strong>4x800m school record</strong> during track season. It was an unforgettable moment, and it truly showed me the power of hard work and teamwork. We pushed each other, supported each other, and accomplished something historic!</p>
        
          <p>Even after high school, my love for running didn’t fade. During Sophmore year in college, I ran the <strong>St. George Marathon</strong>, and it was an incredible experience. Crossing that finish line was a moment of triumph.</p>
        
          <p>Now, I run just for fun! Running has not only kept me physically fit but has also made me feel more mentally clear and relaxed. It’s a wonderful way to de-stress and reconnect with myself. I’ve learned that running isn’t just about going fast or winning races—it's about feeling great, both in body and mind.</p>
        
          <p>When I look back at some of my most memorable moments, they are with my running buddies. Running has been ingrained into a part of who I am.</p>

          <p>Throughout high school, I had a blast playing <strong>ultimate frisbee</strong> with my friends. It was a regular part of our routine, and we'd gather often just for fun. It was a good time.</p>

          <p>When I entered college, I still had the same love for ultimate frisbee, but none of my high school friends were around anymore. So, I joined an <strong>Intramural Ultimate Frisbee team</strong> to keep the fun going. It was awesome to meet new people and have fun running around.</p>

          <p>We ended up winning the <strong>championship</strong>! It was super fun to jump onto a team and win the tournament.</p>

          <p>If you hate running, I'd strongly reccomend ultimate frisbee. It's the perfect way to hide cardio into a game.</p>

          <p>I've played a lot of video games over the years, and it's become the <strong>main activity</strong> that my brothers and I do together.</p>

          <p>It's always fun to interact with them through games, though they tend to beat me in most of them since they're all so good. However, I can still hold my own in Mario Kart!</p>

          <p>Video games provide a great way to bond with my brothers while also helping me relax and unwind.</p>
