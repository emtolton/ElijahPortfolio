          <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Early Education</h3>
          <p>I graduated from Syracuse High School in Utah, where I focused on academics. I took part in a rigorous course load, including Advanced Placement (AP) and Concurrent Enrollment (CE) classes, which allowed me to earn my <strong>Associate's degree</strong> before graduating from high school. This strong academic foundation has been key in shaping my approach to challenges and learning.</p>
          <br>
          <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Current Studies</h3>
          <p>Now, I'm pursuing my passion for technology and innovation by studying Computer Science at the <strong>University of Utah</strong>. I've had the opportunity to learn various programming languages and concepts, expanding my technical knowledge and preparing myself for a career in this rapidly evolving field. I'm graduating with a Bacholer's of <strong>Computer Science in 2027</strong>. I'm excited to continue learning and apply my skills to real-world problems.</p>
          <br>
          <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">A Lifelong Runner</h3>
          <p>Running has grown into a passion for me. Throughout high school, I ran in both the track and cross-country teams. These experiences not only taught me the value of perseverance but also instilled in me a love for competing and constantly improving. Running continues to be a part of my life, helping me stay disciplined and focused in everything I do.</p>
